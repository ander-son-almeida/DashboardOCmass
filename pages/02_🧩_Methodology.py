In this study, we propose a new method to compute the masses of open clusters, here considered as the mass of member stars, which were determined through membership methods. The method is based on the determination of individual cluster member star masses using precise age, distance, metallicity, and extinction parameters obtained from \emph{Gaia} data. To estimate the individual member star masses, synthetic clusters are generated with full control of fundamental parameters. Finally, a Monte Carlo method is used to obtain the final individual masses, as well as their uncertainties, by comparing the observed and generated synthetic clusters. From the individual masses of the stars and an estimation of the unseen mass in low mass stars as well as remnants of evolved stars, the masses of the clusters are obtained. We validate the method by using a set of simulated observations based on synthetic clusters generated from predefined isochrones of given age, distance, extinction and metallicitiy as well as binary fraction.

The procedure is summarized in the steps below:

In our procedure, the estimation of the mass of each member star observed in a given 
open cluster is the fundamental necessary step that needs to be carried out, 
before the cluster mass can be obtained. As mentioned previously, with the open 
cluster member stars defined, the Monte-Carlo method compares generated synthetic 
clusters to the observed ones to determine the masses of the individual member stars. 
To generate the synthetic cluster we need a given set of theoretical isochrones 
and in this work we use the Padova PARSEC version 1.2S set of isochrones described 
in detail in Bressan et al. (2012). The synthetic clusters are generated with a 
predefined number of stars with masses drawn from a probability distribution parameterized 
by the well-known Chabrier initial mass function Chabrier 2003. In this work, 
we adopted a number of generated stars of 10000. A fraction of binary stars of 50% 
is also adopted, with the binary system companion star masses drawn from a 
uniform distribution with values varying from 0 to the primary star mass. Photometric 
errors, as per the Gaia data definition Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016, are also included in the synthetic cluster.

For each star in the observed cluster, we compared its magnitudes to each of the 
10000 stars generated in the synthetic cluster, finding the one with the smallest difference 
in magnitude. This step effectively finds the synthetic star with the minimum Euclidean distance 
from the observed one in magnitude space, according to the following equation:
